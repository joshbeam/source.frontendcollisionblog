Simple answer: because of **minification issues**.

<!--excerpt.start-->Minification can cause modules to use each other as their arguments (unintentionally), if the developer isn't careful.<!--excerpt.end-->

{% highlight javascript %}

(function() {
	// code
})()

(function() {
	// code	
})();

{% endhighlight %}

If you look closely enough at the above, you'll see the first <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/">IIFE</a> is **missing a semicolon at the end**.

That means that when minified, it'll look like this:

# The broken code:

{% highlight javascript %}

(function() {})()(function() {})();

// (a)()(b)()

{% endhighlight %}

The problem is that now function `a` is being called with function `b` passed in as an argument. Interesting.

So, we just add a `;` to the *beginning* of the module, and to the *end*. This acts as a safeguard to ensure we don't run into that problem when we minify.

So, when we try doing the above example with semicolons **at the beginning *and* at the end**, and you minify the code, you get this instead:

# The working code:

{% highlight javascript %}

;(function() {})();;(function() {})();

{% endhighlight %}

The cool thing is, **the above doesn't throw any errors. In fact, <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> won't yell at you either.**

Why is this? Check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/Empty">MDN article on `empty`</a>:

> An **empty** statement is used to provide no statement, although the JavaScript syntax would expect one.

So those extra semicolons are *not* a syntax error, because a random semicolon anywhere in the code can be interpreted as an `empty` statement. Cool, huh?
