		Welcome!
	</h1>

	<p>
		This is the blog of <a href="mailto:frontendcollisionblog@gmail.com">Josh Beam</a>, a software engineer currently in San Francisco.
	</p>

		<strong>
			I develop web sites and apps, like this nifty little <a href="http://periodictable.herokuapp.com">Periodic Table of Elements</a> that college students can use to get better grades in chemistry class without thinking too hard.
		</strong>

		According to the overly-long wall of text in my <a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/joshbeam">Stack Overflow Careers page</a>:

		<blockquote>
			I'm a full-stack developer (primarily JavaScript) in the Bay Area with experience deploying web-based and hybrid mobile applications to production environments, both as a part of a design agency and, most recently, a single-product startup. I like tight version control and deployment automation, and have experience working in Agile environments in small teams of engineers.
			<br><br>
			I started making websites when I was young (throwback to Wordpress), and eventually began to develop an interest in diving more in depth into other programming languages, one of which is Ruby (my most recent project is a CLI that generates AngularJS templates from scratch). I also dabble a bit in native Android applications.
			<br><br>
			My primary focus at the moment is hybrid front-end application and server development in a Node.js environment (using technologies like Cordova, AngularJS, and sometimes BASH for deployment automation). Sometimes it's called the "MEAN stack".
			<br><br>
			I also place value in airtight UI architecting to give the user the most seamless experience possible. For this client-side specific development, I like CSS pre-processors (primarily SASS) and task automation tools like gulp.js. Another "hobby" is semantic, minimalistic HTML, bringing in as few dependencies as possible.
