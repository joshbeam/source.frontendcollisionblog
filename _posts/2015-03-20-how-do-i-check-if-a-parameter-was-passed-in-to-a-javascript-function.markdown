# What's a parameter?
A parameter can also be called an argument. It's the thing passed into a function that you do something with:

{% highlight javascript %}
	
function test(x) {
	return x + 1;
}

test(1); // ==> returns 2

var two = test(1); // this variable is now set to 2

{% endhighlight %}

But what if a function can do something *without* a parameter, or what if the functionality changes based on whether or not a parameter was passed in?

{% highlight javascript %}
	
function test(x) {
	if(x) {
		// do something
	} else {
		// do something else
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, we expect that if `x` "exists", then we'll do something; if not, we'll do something else. But checking for existence is a little more difficult than that. It has to do with truthiness.

# The truth about truthiness

In `if` statements, JavaScript evaluates the statement to a boolean `true` or `false`, and acts accordingly. But when certain values are encountered, JavaScript "coerces" them to a boolean value. For example, these statements are all correct:

## These are all true:
{% highlight javascript %}
	
/*
	1 == true
	0 == false
	' ' == true
	'' == false
	null == false
	undefined == false
*/

{% endhighlight %}

There are plenty of other examples. However, you'll notice above that we're using the `==` operator. This is called the equality operator. It checks if two values are "equal", but to do this, JavaScript coerces the types.

## These are all incorrect (they will evaluate to false):
{% highlight javascript %}
	
/*
	1 === true
	0 === false
	' ' === true
	'' === false
	null === false
	undefined === false
*/

{% endhighlight %}

You'll notice a very subtle, but important, difference here: we're using the `===` operator: also called the identity operator. `1` does not have the identity of `true`, *however*, it is equal to true. This is confusing at first, but this is the principle of truthiness.

This brings us to a very important logical operator, the exlamation point `!` (also called the "not" operator). It gives you the opposite of whatever boolean value you give.

## The "not" operator in action (the following statements are all true)
{% highlight javascript %}
	
/*
	!1 === false
	!0 === true
	!' ' === false
	!'' === true
	!null === true
	!undefined === true
*/

{% endhighlight %}

You'll notice above that we are using the strict identity operator `===`. This is okay, because the `!` operator coerces the values on the left side of the equation to a boolean value. So really when we say `!1 === false`, we're actually saying `false === false`. In other words, `false` *does* have the identity of `false`.

## The "double not" (or just two "not" operators &mdash; these are also all true)
{% highlight javascript %}
	
/*
	!!1 === true
	!!0 === false
	!!' ' === true
	!!'' === false
	!!null === false
	!!undefined === false
*/

{% endhighlight %}

The double not basically coerces each value into its equal boolean form. That's a weird way to say it. Think of it like this: `0 == false` is the same as `!!0 === false`.

# So how do we check for existence?

Well, it depends on how we want to define existence. Do we want to say that the parameter doesn't exist, if it is `null`,`undefined`,`0`,`false`, or some other non-truthy value? What if we want to pass in an empty string (`''`) as a value?

## Bad example:
{% highlight javascript %}
function test(x) {
	if(!!x) {
		console.log('we passed the "if" test');
		console.log('empty strings are okay too');
	}
}

test(null); // logs nothing
test(1); // ==> 'we passed the "if" test'; 'empty strings are okay too'
test(''); // logs nothing... uh oh

// By the way, if(!!x) is basically shorthand for if(x == true)

{% endhighlight %}

So we can combine instead combine logical statements to check for our idea of existence:

## Better example:
{% highlight javascript %}
function test(x) {
	if(!!x || x === '') {
		console.log('we passed the "if" test');
		console.log('empty strings are okay too');
	}
}

test(null); // logs nothing
test(1); // ==> 'we passed the "if" test'; 'empty strings are okay too'
test(''); // ==> 'we passed the "if" test'; 'empty strings are okay too'

// We could even use 'typeof'
function test(x) {
	if(!!x || typeof x === 'string') {
		console.log('we passed the "if" test');
		console.log('empty strings are okay too');
	}
}

// the above function will output the same thing

{% endhighlight %}

## Checking strictly for undefined values:
{% highlight javascript %}
function test() {
	if(a) {
		console.log('a exists!');
	}
}

// The above function will throw a ReferenceError: a is not defined

function test() {
	if(typeof a !== 'undefined')  {
		console.log('a exists!');
	}
}

// This second function won't log anything, but it also won't throw an error!
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, `a` **was never declared**. If a variable is never declared and you try to check for its existence, you'll get an error. But the `typeof` operator is the only operator (to my knowledge) that gets around this. If you check the type of a variable that was never declared, **you won't get an error, and your program can continue**.

## Declared vs. defined
{% highlight javascript %}
var a; // this is a declared variable that exists; its value is undefined

var a = true; // this is now a defined variable; its value is NO LONGER undefined

var b;

console.log(typeof b); // ==> undefined
console.log(!!b); // ==> false

var c;
console.log(typeof c); // ==> undefined
console.log(!!c); // ==> ReferenceError! Your program is dead.
{% endhighlight %}


# Best Practice

I think in this circumstance, <!--excerpt.start-->**the best practice depends on however you define "existence" in the context of your specific function**. This means that you have to take into consideration the concepts of truthiness, the use of the `typeof` operator, the principle of declared vs. defined, etc.<!--excerpt.end-->

Keep in mind, too, that there are many ways to check the types of of variables you encounter. For example:
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = [];

// x.constructor === Array
// typeof x === 'object'
// x.toString() === ''

var y = 'hello';

// y.constructor === String
// typeof y === 'string'
// y.toString() === 'hello'
{% endhighlight %}

This is a topic for another post, but it demonstrates how you can check the types of a variable based on your definition of existence in the context of your specific function.
