          <p>
            
              
"The state of any object can be derived from the events that affect it." In a nutshell, this is the thesis of "event sourcing", which, when implemented in an application, becomes an "event driven architecture". In this post I'll discuss some of the practical applications, benefits, and drawbacks that the team and I have noticed after migrating our current, stateful database to a more event-driven approach.

          <p>
            
              
AngularJS's controllerAs syntax is a good first step into being able to have some sort of sense of hierarchy in applications. However, large controllers can still get unwieldy. We can move towards controlling our controllers with angular.extend.

          <p>
            
              
Recently, some colleagues and I dreadfully spent (read: wasted) valuable man hours attempting to solve a bug in a hybrid mobile app. The cause of the bug? A missing &lt;script&gt; tag. Several important lessons can be learned from the ways in which we decided to go about solving this simple headbanger (no, not like you'd do at a heavy metal concert; rather, where you actually consider banging your head on a solid object) of a problem.

          <p>
            
              
One of the main problems with forEach is that it primarily relies on side effects, whereas some native Array.prototype alternatives make use of semantically-correct programming paradigms (such as reduction, mapping, and filtering) and may in turn introduce less incidental complexity (and enhance readability) when writing code.

Create a nice, modern toggle switch that works by just changing its padding and adding a transition (all it takes is a JavaScript click handler to add or remove a class)!

This post is the second in the series of “From JavaScript to Ruby”, which is aimed at helping JavaScript developers transition their thinking from JavaScript to Ruby. Here you’ll find a table of the ways we do things in JavaScript, and the way you’re supposed to do them in Ruby.

This post is the first in the series of “From JavaScript to Ruby”, which is aimed at helping JavaScript developers transition their thinking from JavaScript to Ruby. This post will answer this fundamental question: how do I do “callbacks” in Ruby? The answer is: the “idiomatic” way (we’ll talk about what “idiomatic” means) to use so-called callbacks in Ruby is to use blocks. We’ll discuss blocks, and their similarities to JavaScript callbacks.

          <p>
            
              
This post is going to talk briefly about the common ways people are shown to write AngularJS controllers, why minifying your code will break your application if you write them in this way, and how to fix this problem.

Today we'll talk about how to build a JavaScript-only search engine (using JSON and AJAX) to avoid databases and server-side programming. We'll do it all specifically in the context of Jekyll and GitHub Pages!

I'm sure you've seen the common for loop written a thousand different ways. Well, in this post, you'll learn one readable way that is good for pretty much most instances where you'll use a for loop (some exceptions are noted, too). Oh, and scroll all the way down for a bonus snippet (we'll create something pretty cool, I think).

This post is going to discuss the reasoning behind a strange-looking syntax style that some people use when declaring JavaScript modules (in the context of immediately invoked function expressions). Simply put, the point of this trick is to get around minification issues when using other people's code (or your own).

So what's this post all about? We're going to examine an interesting alternative for passing dependencies between JavaScript modules. The goal is to avoid any overhead (by using libraries like RequireJS), but also to avoid attaching too many things to the global namespace...

          <p>
            
              
This post is going to talk about checking for the "existence" of a parameter, if we expected one to be there and how to handle this "flow of control", and how we define "checking for existence" in the first place. The fundamental concept behind all of this, as we'll learn, is the fuzzy idea of truthiness (which is different depending on which programming language you're referring too.) We'll see that JavaScript has a very broad idea of truthiness.

          <p>
            
              
What is this strange word "hoisting"? As of the current version of JavaScript (ECMAScript5), there's not really such a thing as block scope, which is something common to lots of other programming languages (there is a caveat though, which we'll learn towards the end of this post.) Hoisting and the non-existence of "block scope" can be confusing. Learn how to overcome this issue.
