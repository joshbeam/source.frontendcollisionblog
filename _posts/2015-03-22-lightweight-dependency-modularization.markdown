# A common approach
A common approach when utilizing the <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript">module pattern</a> or something close to it, is to attach the end object to the `window`, or return the object inside some sort of local variable to create a namespace for your module.

So you might end up having something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
// first.module.js
;(function(win) {
	var exports = //code

	win.firstModule = exports;
})(window);

// several more modules...

// and eventually a module that depends on firstModule

// fifth.module.js
;(function(win,firstModule) {
	// do something with firstModule

	var exports = //code;

	win.fifthModule = exports;
})(window,firstModule);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<!-- then in your html... -->

<script src="first.module.js"></script>
<!-- several other modules -->
<scirpt src="fifth.module.js"></script>

{% endhighlight %}

Of course, the obvious problems with this are:

1. You attach a lot of stuff to the global scope (this can be overcome with various techniques, though)
2. You have to get the order of your `<script>` tags pretty exact (we're pretending we're not using a task runner here, like <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a>)

... and probably several other I'm forgetting about. There are other ways to do this (a popular library like <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a>, for example), but in my case, I wanted to try to use a basic object that would be attached to the `window`, and have all of my dependencies attach to that global object.

# A global dependencies object

For <a href="http://github.com/joshbeam/angular-state-manager">angular-state-manager</a>, I utilized a global object called `stateManagerDependencies`, or something along that line, to attach all of my modules to that would eventually go into the main `stateManager` module.

<!--excerpt.start-->The purpose of this was to only have one object (the `stateManagerDependencies` object) be attached to the global scope (i.e. `window` object), and that would hold all of the dependencies, as opposed to attaching each dependency to the global scope at the end of each module.<!--excerpt.end-->

{% highlight javascript %}
// dependencies.js
;(function(win) {

	win.stateManagerDependencies = {};

})(window);

// first.example.module.js
;(function(dependencies) {
	var dependencies = dependencies;

	// then, use them...
})(stateManagerDependencies);

// etc.

{% endhighlight %}

## Obvious downsides to this approach

1. You're still attaching some strangely named global object to the `window`
2. In each module that depends on the `dependencies` object, there is no error-checking or method to list what modules are available inside the `dependencies` object (a possible fix for this is to simply implement some of those methods, for example: `.list()`, or `.checkFor()`, etc.)
